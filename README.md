# Add to path
Batch script that adds two entries to the context menu in explorer which can add/remove the current directory to the user's environmental path

## Usage
### Install 
1. Run the AddToPath script with administrator priviledges to populate the entries in the registry.
2. Copy it in your %USERPROFILE% (alternatively wherever you want but you need to modify the path inside the script)

Right click on a file inside the directory you wish to add the path to the local user's environmental path.

### Uninstall
Just run CleanUp with admin priviledges.
